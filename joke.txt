A mechanical engineer, an electrical engineer, and a Microsoft programmer were in a car. 
The car suddenly broke down. 
Mechanical engineer said: 
"Hey! It has to be the fuel injection. Lemme fix it." 
The electrical engineer didn't agree: 
"It's probably the battery. I'll fix it." 
The Microsoft programmer shook his head and said: 
"Hey guys, I have a simpler idea: 
Let's just close all the windows, get out of the car, then get back into it, and it should run!"
